    "While many tools exist for static analysis, Python is an especially challenging for analysis because it is a dynamically typed language.  In addition, for SemForms we needed to be able to analyze each script independently for maximal flexibility and handle all sorts of imports of user libraries.  We built a layer of analysis technology on top of [WALA](https://github.com/wala/WALA) to handle calls to arbitrary libraries and creates data flow and control flow graphs from it [Graph4Code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09440.pdf).  We note that many popular tools for static analysis on Python do not have the mechanisms to support the data flow graph we need for expression extraction. "
